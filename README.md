##Script files - how they work and how they are connected

This repo contains only one script file: run_analysis.R
The purpose of this file is to create a tidy data set from a number of test and training sets from a pre-downloaded and extracted zip file from the following location: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip 
The columns of the resulting tidy data set are labelled with user friendly descriptions (descriptive variable names) rather than codes.  The resulting tidy data set is called tidydata.csv

Please see CodeBook.md for more detail on the data and the transforms completed.
